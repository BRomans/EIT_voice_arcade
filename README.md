# Turkey Jump! - an EIT voice arcade project
For this project our goal was to experiment with new interaction techniques inside well-known contexts. Video Games are the intersection point between science and art and we believe they perfectly fit into the spirit of Human Computer Interaction. 
We decided to revisit a very popular game, Flappy Bird, an endless platformer that became famous a few years ago thanks to YouTube videos of players struggling while trying to challenge the simple but difficult mechanic of the game. 
All of these videos have in common the fact that players used to scream very often while playing due to the difficulty, so we decided to turn these screams into a new way of interacting with the game.
